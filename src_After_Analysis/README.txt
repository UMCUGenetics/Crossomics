README - Crossomics After Analysis

2019-09-13 - Marten Kerkhofs

This repository is for analysing the results of the MetabMapper.R script. It currently contains 2 scripts: Summarise_MSEA_results.R and Prioritised_gene_analysis.R.

Summarise_MSEA_results.R takes the output of the MetabMapper scripts and summarises the MSEA_results to a single datatable.

Prioritised_gene_analysis.R takes the single datatable from Summarise_MSEA_results.R and it performs data visualisation. Additional mutations to the datatable are performed to get results per patient and/or per parameter combination.
