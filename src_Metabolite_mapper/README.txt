README - Crossomics Metabolite Mapper

04-07-2019 - Marten Kerkhofs



This repository is for all necessary Crossomics Metabolite Mapper scripts. The data used is in the parent folder (Data) and on the Metab drive in a project specific path. 

The main script is GeneMetaboliteMapper.R. Scripts used by the main script are in the Supportive folder and are: getZValues_11042019.R, MSEA.R, genExcelFileShort.R, sourceDir.R and Generate_av_Z_scores.R. 
Other scripts do not have any use in the Metabolite_Mapper script and are moved to 'old/unnecessary' folders.
